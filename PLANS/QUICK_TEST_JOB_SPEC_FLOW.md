## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No spec shows in Step 1

**Fix**: Check style name mapping in `mapStyleToTemplateSlug()`. Style name must match template key.

### Issue: No stylists appear in Step 3

**Fix**: Check if any stylist has the required skill in their `skills` array. May need to add style to stylist skills.

### Issue: Quote doesn't appear after submission

**Fix**: Refresh the booking success page. LocalStorage requires manual refresh without real-time sync.

### Issue: Can't see braider dashboard

**Fix**: Go to `/dashboard` and look for green "Braider Dashboard" card. Should be 4th item.
