## Troubleshooting

### "Vision API not configured"

**Likely cause**: API not enabled
**Fix**: Enable Cloud Vision API in Google Cloud Console

### Takes too long (> 10 seconds)

**Likely cause**: Slow internet or large image
**Fix**: Use smaller image (< 2MB)

### Shows wrong hair type

**Expected**: Vision API is learning, detection improves over time
**Note**: Users can still select manually if needed

---

1. Analysis box appears after upload
2. Hair type OR health score shown
3. At least some labels displayed
4. No error messages

✅ **Form works even if API fails**:

2. Booking continues normally
3. Yellow info message shown
4. No crashes or breaks
