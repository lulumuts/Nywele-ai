2. `app/components/SpecSummary.tsx` - Displays spec in booking
3. `app/components/QuoteEditor.tsx` - Braider quote form
4. `app/braiders/page.tsx` - Braider dashboard

## Files Modified (2)

1. `app/booking-flow/page.tsx` - Integrated spec, matching, quotes
2. `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added braider dashboard link

## Documentation Created (3)

1. `JOB_SPEC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete technical details
2. `QUICK_TEST_JOB_SPEC_FLOW.md` - 5-minute test script
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - This file

## Ready to Test!

**Server**: `http://localhost:3000` ‚úÖ Running

**Test Flow** (5 minutes):

1. Book style ‚Üí See spec with products/cost
2. Smart matching ‚Üí Only qualified stylists
3. Confirm booking ‚Üí Status: Waiting for Quote
4. Braider dashboard ‚Üí Submit quote
5. Customer ‚Üí View and approve quote

**See**: `QUICK_TEST_JOB_SPEC_FLOW.md` for detailed test script

---

## What Was Deferred

### Supabase Auth (By User Request)

- User authentication
- Database storage
- RLS policies
- Will implement later with full plan in `SUPABASE_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### AI Features (Phase 2)

- Image recognition (Vision API)
- CLIP similarity matching
- Dynamic pricing
- Will add after user testing

---

## Current State: LocalStorage Prototype

**Purpose**: Proof of concept for user testing and feedback

**Limitations**:

- Single browser (no multi-device)
- No real-time updates
- Manual refresh needed for quote status
- No notifications

**Advantages**:

- Fast to implement
- Easy to test
- No backend setup required
- Perfect for demos

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)

1. ‚úÖ Test E2E flow using `QUICK_TEST_JOB_SPEC_FLOW.md`
2. ‚úÖ Verify all 6 style templates work
3. ‚úÖ Check smart matching filters correctly
4. ‚úÖ Test quote submission and approval

### Short Term (Next Session)

1. Gather user feedback on:
   - Spec display (is pricing clear?)
   - Matching results (are stylists appropriate?)
   - Quote process (is workflow intuitive?)
2. Refine based on feedback
3. Add portfolio tagging to stylists page
4. Enhance recommendations with spec data

### Medium Term (When Ready)

1. Implement Supabase auth (3-hour plan ready)
2. Migrate localStorage to database
3. Add real-time quote notifications
4. Build booking history view

### Long Term (Future)

1. AI image recognition
2. CLIP portfolio matching
3. Dynamic pricing
4. Inventory management
5. Multi-braider coordination

## Technical Highlights

### Spec Generation

- Template-based (easy to add new styles)
- Automatic calculations (no manual math)
- Realistic Kenyan market pricing

### Matching Algorithm

```typescript
Filter: stylist.skills.includes(styleSlug)
     && stylist.availabilityHoursPerDay >= requiredHours
Sort: rating (desc) ‚Üí price proximity
```

### Quote Workflow

```
Customer confirms
  ‚Üí Job to inbox (status: pending_quote)
  ‚Üí Braider edits quote
  ‚Üí Quote submitted (status: quote_submitted)
  ‚Üí Customer views/approves
  ‚Üí Booking confirmed (status: confirmed)
```

### Data Persistence

```
localStorage:
  - nywele-latest-booking (with spec + quote + status)
  - nywele-jobs-inbox (array of jobs)
  - nywele-quote-{id} (individual quotes)
```
