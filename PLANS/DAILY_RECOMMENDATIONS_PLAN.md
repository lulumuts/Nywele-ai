## 🤖 How Recommendations Will Work

### Data Flow:

```
User Profile → AI Logic → Daily Tips
     ↓            ↓           ↓
  Stored in   Analyzes    Shows in
 localStorage  Context     /recommendations
```

### Context Factors:

1. **Time-based**:

   - Days since last wash
   - Weeks in protective style
   - Season (winter dryness vs. summer humidity)

2. **Progress-based**:

   - Hair growth milestones
   - Goal completion
   - Habit streaks

3. **Event-based**:

   - Upcoming calendar events
   - Style refresh reminders
   - Product restock alerts

4. **Behavior-based**:
   - Completed vs. ignored tips
   - Most helpful categories
   - Engagement patterns

### Recommendation Engine:

```typescript
function generateDailyTips(profile, context) {
  const tips = [];

  // Routine tips
  if (daysSinceWash(profile) >= washFrequency(profile)) {
    tips.push(washDayReminder());
  }

  // Product tips
  if (profile.porosity === "high" && weather.humidity < 40) {
    tips.push(moistureTip());
  }

  // Style tips
  if (weeksInStyle(profile) >= 6) {
    tips.push(styleRefreshReminder());
  }

  // Health tips
  if (profile.concerns.includes("breakage")) {
    tips.push(proteinTreatmentTip());
  }

  return tips;
}
```
