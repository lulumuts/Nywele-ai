# ✨ Simplified Nywele.ai Platform

## 🎯 What Changed

We've **streamlined the platform** to focus on the **core booking experience** with cost information integrated throughout.

---

## ❌ Features Removed

### 1. Progress Tracker (`/progress`)

- **Removed**: Photo timeline and measurements tracking
- **Why**: Added complexity without supporting core booking flow

### 2. Hair Care Calendar (`/calendar`)

- **Removed**: Separate calendar with wash day reminders
- **Why**: Can be handled by phone calendar apps

### 3. Cost Tracker (`/cost-tracker`)

- **Removed**: Standalone expense tracking page
- **Why**: Cost info now integrated into booking flow

### 4. Product Calculator (`/product-calculator`)

- **Removed**: Product longevity calculator
- **Why**: Feature was unclear and didn't fit core flow

### 5. AI Chat (`/chat`)

- **Replaced**: Generic chat with personalized recommendations
- **Why**: Recommendations based on actual bookings are more valuable
