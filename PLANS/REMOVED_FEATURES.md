## Why Daily Recommendations is Better

**Before (AI Chat):**

- Generic chat interface
- User has to ask questions
- No context about their hair
- One-off conversations
- Reactive instead of proactive

**After (Daily Recommendations):**

- ✨ Personalized daily tips
- ✨ Proactive suggestions
- ✨ Based on hair profile
- ✨ Contextual to routine, weather, progress
- ✨ Actionable tasks
- ✨ Integrates with calendar & tracker

## Next Steps for Daily Recommendations

- Concerns (breakage, dryness, scalp health)
- Style preferences
- Budget range
- Climate/location

### 2. Save User Profile

### 3. Generate Smart Recommendations

Based on multiple factors:

- Time since last wash day
- Weather conditions (humidity, temperature)
- Style cycle (weeks in protective style)

- Progress photos analysis

### 4. Recommendation Types

- **Routine**: Wash day reminders, deep conditioning
- **Product**: When to moisturize, product application tips
- **Style**: Refresh reminders, protective style suggestions

- **Budget**: Product deals, DIY alternatives

### 5. Track Completion
