  "hairType": "4c",
  "hairGoals": ["growth", "moisture"],
  "createdAt": "2025-10-20T..."

  "desiredStyle": "box-braids",

## 🎨 Key Features

✅ **3-Step Registration** - Not overwhelming

✅ **Smart Recommendations** - Based on profile + booking  
✅ **Editable Profile** - Change goals anytime  
✅ **Dashboard Integration** - Shows login status

---

## 📊 Recommendation Logic

### Without Booking (Just Profile)

- Tips based on hair type
- Tips based on selected goals
- Generic but personalized

### With Booking (Profile + Booking)

- All of the above PLUS:
- Tips mention specific style by name
- Style-specific maintenance advice
- Cost and duration info integrated

**Example**:

- **Without booking**: "For 4C hair, use the LOC method"
- **With booking**: "With 4C hair and box braids, moisturize 2-3x weekly"
