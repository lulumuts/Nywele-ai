# Job Specification & Matching Implementation Summary

## Status: ‚úÖ Complete (LocalStorage Prototype)

**Implementation Date**: October 20, 2025

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Job Specification Generator (`lib/specs.ts`)

**Purpose**: Generate detailed job specifications from curated style templates

**Features**:

- 6 seeded style templates (knotless braids, box braids, twists, cornrows, locs)
- Each template includes:
  - Time estimate (min/max hours)
  - Required products with quantities and costs (KES)
  - Hair requirements (minimum length, suitable textures)
  - Skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
  - Complexity rating
- Automatic cost calculation (product subtotals, total materials)
- Style slug mapping for consistency

**Key Functions**:

- `generateJobSpec(styleSlug)`: Returns full spec with calculated costs
- `mapStyleToTemplateSlug()`: Maps booking style names to template keys
- `getAvailableStyles()`: Lists all available templates

---

### 2. UI Components

#### SpecSummary (`app/components/SpecSummary.tsx`)

- Displays job specification in booking flow
- Shows:
  - Time estimate
  - Product list with quantities and costs
  - Total materials cost range
  - Hair requirements
- Used in booking Step 1

#### QuoteEditor (`app/components/QuoteEditor.tsx`)

- Braider interface for editing quotes
- Features:
  - Editable product list (add/remove/modify)
  - Labor cost input
  - Notes field
  - Real-time total calculation
  - Submit quote action
- Pre-populated with spec defaults

---

### 3. Booking Flow Enhancements (`app/booking-flow/page.tsx`)

**Step 1 - Style Review**:

- Now generates and displays full job spec
- Shows SpecSummary component with products/time/cost
- Removed generic cost estimates in favor of spec data

**Step 3 - Smart Stylist Matching**:

- Enhanced stylist data with:
  - `skills` array (for matching)
  - `availabilityHoursPerDay` (for duration fit)
- Matching logic:
  - Hard filter: must have required skill
  - Hard filter: must have enough hours available
  - Sort by: rating ‚Üí price proximity
- Filters out stylists who can't complete the job

**Booking Confirmation**:

- Saves `spec` and `status` with booking
- Creates job entry in `nywele-jobs-inbox`
- Job includes: bookingId, styleSlug, spec, customer info, status

**Success Screen**:

- Status badge system:
  - ‚è≥ Waiting for Quote (pending_quote)
  - üí∞ Quote Received (quote_submitted)
  - ‚úÖ Confirmed (confirmed)
- "View Quote" button when quote submitted
- Quote modal with full details and approval action
- Approve quote ‚Üí updates status to 'confirmed'

---

### 4. Braider Dashboard (`app/braiders/page.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Demo interface for braiders to review jobs and submit quotes

**Features**:

- Job inbox showing pending quote requests
- Each job displays:
  - Style name
  - Customer hair type
  - Requested date/time
  - Time estimate
  - Materials cost estimate
- "Review & Submit Quote" opens QuoteEditor
- Quote submission:
  - Saves quote to localStorage
  - Updates booking status
  - Moves job out of pending inbox

**Data Flow**:

- Reads from `nywele-jobs-inbox`
- Writes quotes to `nywele-quote-{bookingId}`
- Updates `nywele-latest-booking` with quote and status

---

### 5. Dashboard Link

**Addition**: New feature card for "Braider Dashboard"

- Icon: Briefcase
- Color: Green
- Links to `/braiders`
- Labeled "(Demo)" to indicate prototype status

---

---

## Smart Matching Logic

### Inputs

- Style slug (e.g., "knotless-braids")
- Required hours (from spec: time_max_hours)
- Customer hair type (for future enhancement)

### Filtering

1. **Skill Match**: Stylist must have style in `skills` array
2. **Availability Match**: Stylist `availabilityHoursPerDay` ‚â• required hours

### Sorting

1. Higher rating first
2. Mid-range price preferred (over budget/premium)

### Result

- Only stylists who can complete the job
- Best matches at top
- Fallback to top 2 stylists if no perfect matches

---

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Knotless Braids

```
1. Select "Knotless Braids" style
2. Step 1: Verify spec shows:
   - Time: 6-8 hours
   - Products: Xpression hair (6-8 packs @ KES 1,200), edge control, shine spray
   - Total materials: KES 7,500-10,300
3. Step 3: Verify only "Amara Okonkwo" appears (has knotless-braids skill + 10 hours available)
4. Confirm booking
5. Check braiders dashboard: job appears
6. Submit quote with labor KES 5,000
7. Back to booking: status shows "Quote Received"
8. View and approve quote
9. Status updates to "Confirmed"
```

### Test Scenario 2: Goddess Locs

```
1. Select "Goddess Locs" style
2. Step 1: Verify spec shows 6-10 hours
3. Step 3: Verify only "Thandiwe Mwangi" appears (12 hours available)
4. Others filtered out (not enough hours)
```

## Technical Details

### File Structure

```
lib/
  specs.ts                    # Core spec generator
app/
  components/
    SpecSummary.tsx           # Displays spec
    QuoteEditor.tsx           # Braider quote form
  booking-flow/page.tsx       # Enhanced with spec + matching
  braiders/page.tsx           # Braider dashboard
  dashboard/page.tsx          # Added braider link
```

### Dependencies

- No new packages required
- Uses existing: framer-motion, lucide-react

### Performance

- Spec generation: O(1) lookup
- Matching: O(n) filter + O(n log n) sort (n = stylists)
- All operations client-side, instant

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

### AI Integration (Deferred)

- Image recognition to auto-detect style from uploads
- CLIP embeddings for portfolio similarity matching
- Dynamic pricing based on complexity analysis

### Portfolio Tagging (Partial)

- Stylists can upload portfolio images
- Tag images with styles
- Match customers to stylists with similar work

### Supabase Migration (Planned)

- Move from localStorage to real database
- User authentication
- Real-time updates (quote notifications)
- Booking history

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Browser**: LocalStorage means customer and braider must demo in same browser
2. **No Notifications**: Quote submission doesn't notify customer (manual refresh needed)
3. **Static Templates**: Can't create custom styles yet
4. **No Inventory**: Braiders can't track product stock
5. **No Calendar Integration**: Dates don't check real availability

---

## Success Metrics

**Proof of Concept Goals**: ‚úÖ All Met

- [x] Display products/time/cost in booking
- [x] Filter stylists by skills + availability
- [x] Braider can adjust and submit quotes
