## 🚀 What This Enables

### Immediate Benefits

3. **Booking History**: See all past bookings
4. **Progress Tracking**: Hair journey timeline
5. **Email Notifications**: Appointment reminders, tips

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Pre-Supabase)

1. **Single User Per Browser**: localStorage limits to one user
2. **No Real Security**: No passwords or authentication
3. **No Persistence Across Devices**: Data stays in browser
4. **No Email Verification**: Email field is just text input
5. **No Multi-Profile Support**: Can't switch between users

**All of these will be resolved with Supabase integration!**
