## Smart Salon Matching

### Filtering Logic

Salons are filtered by:

1. **Skill Match**: Must have the required style skill
2. **Availability**: Must have enough hours per day for the style
3. **Budget**: Price range must match user's budget
4. **Rating**: Sorted by highest rating first

### Example

```
User selects:
- Style: Knotless Braids (6-8 hours)
- Budget: KES 3,000-5,000
- Time: Weekend

Results:
✅ Amara (mid-range, 10hrs/day, knotless-braids skill)
❌ Thandiwe (premium, out of budget)
❌ Keisha (budget, only 5hrs/day, not enough time)
```
