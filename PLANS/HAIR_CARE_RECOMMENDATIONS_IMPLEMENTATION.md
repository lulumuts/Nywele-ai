# Hair Care Recommendations - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive AI-powered hair care recommendation system that generates personalized daily, weekly, and monthly routines based on hair analysis, goals, and lifestyle.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. **Core Library (`lib/hairCare.ts`)**

#### Data Models & Interfaces

- âœ… `HairCareProfile` - Complete user hair profile with analysis, goals, concerns, lifestyle
- âœ… `RoutineStep` - Individual steps with importance levels, timing, products, reasoning
- âœ… `ProductRecommendation` - Product details with alternatives and pricing
- âœ… `HairCareRecommendation` - Complete routine output with schedules and tips

#### Core Algorithms Implemented

**Needs Assessment**

```typescript
identifyPrimaryNeeds(profile: HairCareProfile): string[]
```

- Analyzes hair health (0-100 score)
- Evaluates porosity (low/medium/high)
- Considers user goals (growth, moisture, strength, shine, protective)
- Addresses concerns (breakage, dryness, thinning, dandruff)
- Returns prioritized list of hair care needs

**Daily Routine Generator**

```typescript
buildDailyRoutine(profile, needs): RoutineStep[]
```

- Morning style refresh
- Daily scalp moisturizing
- Night protection (satin/silk)
- Optional night oil treatment (based on needs)

**Weekly Routine Generator**

```typescript
buildWeeklyRoutine(profile, needs): RoutineStep[]
```

- Scalp cleansing (1-2x per week based on activity level)
- Deep conditioning (essential for all)
- Protein treatments (if repair/strength needed)
- Scalp massage for growth (if goal)
- Leave-in conditioner application

**Monthly Routine Generator**

```typescript
buildMonthlyRoutine(profile, needs): RoutineStep[]
```

- Clarifying wash (removes buildup)
- Hot oil treatment (deep moisture)
- Trimming schedule (based on health score)
- Porosity-specific treatments (ACV rinse for high porosity)

**Maintenance Schedule**

```typescript
createMaintenanceSchedule(profile): Schedule
```

- Next trim date (6-8 weeks based on health)
- Next deep condition (7 days)
- Next protein treatment (1-2 weeks based on health)
- Style refresh date (if current style exists)

**Personalized Tips**

```typescript
generatePersonalizedTips(profile): Tips
```

- Dos: Universal + porosity-specific + goal-specific
- Don'ts: Essential warnings + hair type considerations
- Pro Tips: Advanced techniques with emojis ðŸ’¡

**Expected Results Calculator**

```typescript
calculateExpectedResults(profile, needs): Results
```

- Timeline estimate (2-8 weeks based on health)
- Predicted improvements (specific to goals/needs)
- Health improvement percentage (10-30%)
- Moisture & strength level predictions

**Confidence Score**

```typescript
calculateConfidence(profile): number
```

- Base 50% + increments for each data point
- Higher confidence with more complete profiles
- Range: 50-100%

### 2. **API Endpoint (`/api/hair-care-routine`)**

#### Request Format

```typescript
POST /api/hair-care-routine
{
  hairAnalysis: {
    type: string,
    health: number,
    texture: string,
    density: string,

  },
  currentStyle?: { name, installedDate, maintenanceDue },
  goals: string[],
  concerns: string[],
  lifestyle: { activity, climate, budget },
  allergies?: string[]
}
```

#### Response Format

    daily: RoutineStep[],
    weekly: RoutineStep[],
    monthly: RoutineStep[]
  },
  maintenanceSchedule: {
