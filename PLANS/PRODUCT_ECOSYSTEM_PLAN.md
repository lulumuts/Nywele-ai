  currentStyle?: string,
  routine?: HairCareRecommendation,
  budget?: { min: number; max: number }
): ProductRecommendation[] {
  // Step 1: Get products suitable for hair type & porosity
  const suitableProducts = filterBySuitability(allProducts, hairProfile);

  // Step 2: Match to routine steps
  if (routine) {
    products = matchToRoutineSteps(suitableProducts, routine);
  }

  // Step 3: Match to hairstyle needs
  if (currentStyle) {
    products = addStyleProducts(products, currentStyle);
  }

  // Step 4: Score each product
  const scored = products.map((p) => ({
    product: p,
    score: scoreProduct(p, hairProfile, budget),
    reasons: generateReasons(p, hairProfile),
  }));

  // Step 5: Sort by score and budget
  return optimizeForBudget(scored, budget);
}
```
