**IMPORTANT**: You need to add two new columns to your `analytics_events` table.

### Step 1: Go to Supabase
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor** ‚Üí **New Query**

### Step 2: Run This SQL
```sql
-- Add product_name and salon_name columns
ALTER TABLE analytics_events 
ADD COLUMN product_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN salon_name TEXT;

-- Add indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON analytics_events(product_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_salon_name ON analytics_events(salon_name);
```

### Step 3: Verify
Go to **Table Editor** ‚Üí `analytics_events` and confirm you see:
- `product_name` column
- `salon_name` column

## üöÄ When You Add Salons

When you're ready to add salon functionality, tracking is super easy:

```typescript
import { trackSalonView } from '@/lib/analytics';

// When a user views a salon
trackSalonView({
  salonName: 'Hair by Amara',
  location: 'Nairobi, Kenya',
  services: ['Braids', 'Twists', 'Weaves'],
  hairType: userHairType, // optional
});
```

The analytics dashboard will automatically start showing salon data!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"No product clicks yet"**
- Make sure you ran the SQL query in Supabase
- Clear your browser cache
- Click "Shop Now" on a product and check the terminal logs

**Errors in console**
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
- Check that the table columns exist in Supabase

**Analytics page empty**
- This is normal if you haven't used the app yet
- Complete a full flow: form ‚Üí results ‚Üí product click
- Then visit `/analytics`
