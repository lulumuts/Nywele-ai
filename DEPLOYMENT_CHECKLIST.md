## Status Check (Do This NOW):

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your `nywele-ai` project

2. **Check Deployment Status:**
   - Look for the latest deployment (should be building or completed)
   - Status should be: "Building..." → "Ready ✓"
   - If "Error ❌", click to see build logs

3. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Confirm all 4 variables are there:
     - ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY
     - ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY
     - ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
     - ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

4. **Get Your Production URL:**

   - Open the production URL
   - Fill out the profile form
   - Submit and wait for recommendations
   - Verify results page shows properly

## If Build Fails:

Check the error message in Vercel build logs. Common issues:

## Current Status:

- ⏳ Waiting for Vercel to build...
- 🎯 Expected: Build should complete in ~2-3 minutes
